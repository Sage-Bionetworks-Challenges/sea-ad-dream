"""Template scoring script.

Script is currently designed for evaluating submissions for a
single-task challenge.

At a minimum, you will need to:
    1. Define the expected data structures (see GROUNDTRUTH_COLS and
       PREDICTION_COLS)
    2. Customize score_task1() to fit your specific scoring needs
    3. Add helper functions and manage dependencies as needed for your
       scoring process

For challenges with multiple tasks, create additional `score_task*()`
functions and update the `score()` function to route evaluation to
the appropriate task.
